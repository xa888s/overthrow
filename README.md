# overthrow
Overthrow is an implementation of a server and engine based on the card game [Coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_(card_game)). 
This project includes an engine based around a state machine that can be used to implement your own backend. 

### Server
There is also a server implementation included. The server uses WebSockets making it fairly simple to implement your own client
by taking a look at the autogenerated JSON Schema. Documentation is in progress.
